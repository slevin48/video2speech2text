this program is brought to you by Stanford University please visit us at stanford.edu thank you i'mma honoured to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world truth be told I never from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a College graduation today I want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories the first story is about connecting the dotsI dropped that we college after the first 6 months but then stayed around is a drop in for another 18 months or so before I really quit so wide I drop out it started before I was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that I should be adopted by College graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at Birth by lawyer and his wife accept it when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really want a girl so my parents who are waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we got an unexpected baby boy you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and my father had never graduate from High School shesign the final adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college this was the start in my life and 17 years later I did go to college but I'm not even a college it was almost as expensive is Stanford and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition after 6-months I couldn't see the value in it I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how College was going to help me figure it out and here I was spending all the money my parents save their entire life so I decided to drop out and trust it would all work out ok it was pretty scary the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made the minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest medropping in on the ones that look far more interesting it wasn't all romantic I didn't have a dorm room so I slept on the floor in French rooms I return Coke bottles for the 5% deposit to buy food with and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari Krishna temple I loved it and much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example re college at that time after perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country throughout the Campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautiful and calligraphed because I have dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this I learnt about serif and sans serif typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinationswhat makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically saddle in a way that science can't capture and I found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but 10 years later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the Mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography if I had never dropped in on that simple course and college the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces are proportionally spaced fonts and since Windows just copy the Mac it's likely that no personal computer would have them if I had never dropped out I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossibleconnect the dots looking forward when I was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards 10 years later again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing with the darts will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leaves you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference my second story is about love and loss I was lucky I found what I love to do early in life was a nice started apple in my parents garage when I was 20 we were tired and in 10-years apple grown from just the two of us and a garage into a 2 billion dollar company with over 4000 employeeswe just released our finest creation the Macintosh are you earlier and I just turned 30 and then I got fired how can you get fired from a company you started well as apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run a company with me and for the first year so things went well but then revisions the future began to diverge and eventually we are falling out when we did or board of directors sided with him and so 8:30 I was out and very publicly out what have been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating I really don't know what to do for a few months I felt that I'd let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that I drop the baton it was being passed me I met with David Packard and Bob noise and try to apologise for screwing up so badly I was a very public failure and I even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly beI still loved what I did The Turn of events at apple is not changed one bit I've been rejected but I was still in love and so I decided to start over I didn't see it then but it turned out again fire from Apple was the best thing that could ever happen to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the Lightness of Being a beginner again less sure about everything it's free meet anyone at the most creative periods of my life during the next five years I started a company name next another company name Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife to create the world's first computer animated feature film Toy Story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable Turn Of Events apple bought next and I return to Apple in the technology developed at next at the heart of apples current Renaissancehave a wonderful family together I'm pretty sure none of this would happen if I hadn't been fired from Apple it was awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it sometime life sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick don't lose Faith I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I love what I did you've got to find what you love and that is truth work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet keep looking and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking don't settlemy third story is about death when I was 17 I read a quote that when something like if you live each day as if it was your last Sunday you're most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life would I want to do what I'm about to do today and whenever the answer is Beano for too many days in a row I know I need to change something remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important to allied ever encounter to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations or pride of fear of embarrassment of failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly importantremembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart about a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas I don't even know what a pancreas was the doctor's told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable in the life expectancy of no longer than 3 to 6-months my doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order which is Doctors code for prepared to die it means the try and tell your kids everything you thought you have the next 10 years to tell him in just a few months it means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that will be as easy as possible for your family it means to say your goodbyesI live with that diagnosis all day later that evening I had a biopsy with a stuck in endoscope down my throat through my stomach and my intestines put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor I was sedated but my wife who is there told me that when they view the cells under a microscope the doctor started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is terrible with surgery I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now this was the closest I've been to facing that and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades having lived through it I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than one that was a useful but purely intellectual concept no one wants to die even people who want to go to heavenhow to get there and yet that is the destination we all share no one is ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it's life change agent it clears out the Old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not to warn from now you were gradually becoming old and be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite true your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life don't be trapped by Dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondarywhen I was young there was an amazing publication called the whole earth catalogue which was one of the bibles of my generation it was created by a fellow name Stuart Brand not far from here in menlo park and he brought it to life with his poetic touch this was in the late 60s before personal computers and desktop publishing so it was all made with typewriters scissors in Polaroid cameras it was sort of like Google and paperback for 35 years before Google came along it was idealistic overflowing with need tools and great notions store and his team put out several issues of the whole earth catalogue and then when it run its course they put out of final issue it was the mid 1970s and I was your age on the back cover of there finallywas a photograph of an early morning country road the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous beneath with the words stay hungry stay foolish it was their farewell message as they signed off stay hungry stay foolish and I have always wished that for myself and now as you graduated beginning new I wish that for you stay hungry stay foolish thank you all very much the preceding program is
